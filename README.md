# aerick-phrasing

A phrasing system for Plover.

Heavily inspired by [JadeGG's own phrasing system](https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing). The majority of starters, middles, and ending words are from there.

This system allows you to write common phrases in one stroke, such as "I don't really even care about".

However, the actual [python dictionary](https://pypi.org/project/plover-python-dictionary/) has practically been rewritten to accommodate for features that the original does not have.

## Changes With this System

### "doesn't" and "don't" use the same keys

With the original system, `E` is used for `doesn't` while `OE` is used for `don't`. This means that there is space taken up by grammatically incorrect phrases such as `he don't want to` (`KWHROEPT`).

With this system, the middle word represented by `OE` changes depending on the pronoun. So while `KPWHOEPT` would output `it doesn't want to`, `SWROEPT` would result in `I don't want to` despite using the same vowel keys.

### Plurals are automatic

With the original system, to write a phrase such as `she really cares about`, one would have to stroke it as `SKWHRARBGTS` with the S pluralising the word `care`. However, with this system, this is taken care of and stroking `SKWHRARBGT` is sufficient. On the other hand, using the same ending and middle word but with the pronoun `I` will not pluralise. `SWRARBGT` → `I really care about`.

Currently a `❌` in the entries of the endings dictionary will prevent it from automatically being pluralised.

### Number key used in middles

The dictionary recognises the `AOEU` keys as `XYQN` to differentiate between when the number key has been pressed for the vowels (this is only important if you intend to change the medials).

### Final medial with the `-F` key

I've assigned this to be the word `even`, so that phrases such as `I didn't even know that` are now possible. The placement of this word is always on the end of the middle words.

All of these changes have added quite a bit of space for new phrases. Currently, I am not entirely certain what I'll be using all this new space for. The dictionary may change with my usage over time. At the moment I'm thinking that the "number keyed" vowels may not be optimal (`should`, `could` and `would` are all potential candidates).

## Overview of the system

**Starting words**
- `SWR`: `I`
- `KPWR`: `you`
- `KWHR`: `he`
- `SKWHR`: `she`
- `TWH`: `they`
- `TWR`: `we`
- `KPWH`: `it`
- `STKPWHR`: ` ` (nothing)
  - Plural form of phrases (e.g. `STKPWHRPT`: `wants to`)
  - `STKPWHROE`: `doesn't`
  - `#STKPWHROE`: `does`
- `STWR`: ` ` (nothing)
  - Singular form of phrases (e.g. `STWRPT`: `want to`)
  - `STKPWHROE`: `don't`
  - `#STKPWHROE`: `do`

**Middle words**
- `A`: `really`
- `O`: `can't`
- `OE`: `don't`/`doesn't` (depends on pronoun)
- `E`: `just`
- `U`: `really`
- `-F`: `even`
- `AU`: `didn't`
- `AEU`: `didn't really`
- `AOU`: `really didn't`
- `AOEU`: `kinda`
- `AOEUF`: `kind of`

> NOTE: When using `A` and `U` with `O`, `OE`, and `E`, the word `really` can be either appended or prepended to the middle word (e.g., `AOE` → `don't really`, `AE` → `really just`).

> NOTE: `E` can be added in for the word `even`. It is always at the end of the middle words (e.g., `OUF` → `can't really even`).

> Memorisation tip: as for `really didn't` and `didn't really`, the side with two keys represents `really` (I think of the word `didn't` as one syllable, and therefore gets one key while `really` - having two syllables - gets two).

**With number key**
- `A`: `have`
- `AO`: `haven't`
- `OU`: `haven't really`
- `O`: `can`
- `AOE`: `really do`
- `OE`: `do`
- `OEU`: `do really`
- `AE`: `really just didn't`
- `E`: `just didn't`
- `EU`: `just didn't really`
- `U`: `really`
- `AOU`: `really did`
- `AU`: `did`
- `AEU`: `did really`
- `AOEU`: `ever`
- `AOEUF`: `ever just`
- `F`: `even`

**Endings**

All endings comprise of a "root" word (`know`, `find`, `see`, etc) and a final word represented by `-T`. What exactly this last word is depends on the root, but is usually `to` or `that` (e.g., `-PB` → `know` and `-PBT` → `know that`). Using the asterisk `*T` will result in other last words (usually `the`, e.g., `*PBT` → `know the`).

To get the past tense of the root word, `-D` is used. For example `-PB` → `know`, and `-PBD` → `knew`. This can also be used together with the `-T` (`-PBTD` → `knew that`).

For root words that end in `-S` (e.g., `-RBS` → wish, `-RPLS` → matter) the pattern is different. `-T` is still used to get the final word (`-RBTS` → `wish to`) but since pressing `-D` would require a shift, `-Z` is used for past tense (`-RBSZ` → `wished`). Similarly, since pressing `-TZ` would require a shift, `-TSDZ` is used for past tense in combination with a final word (`-RBTSDZ` → `wished to`).

While there aren't many words that currently use this exception, `-S` is free to be used with many more ending words since it has been freed up by the automatic pluralising functionality.

> With Jade's system, `-S` would be used to pluralise, and wasn't available for use in root words.
